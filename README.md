Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Goal: Projects high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while maximizing variance.

How it Works:

Computes new axes (principal components) that capture the most variance in the data.

Projects data onto these new axes, reducing dimensionality.

Example Use Case: Reducing a dataset with 100 features to 2 or 3 while retaining most of the information.
